# Naruto
It's a basic guess the character game. The characters are from the anime Naruto.

First you have to set the difficulty level. 
Sasuke == Easy; 
Naruto == Medium; 
Itachi == Hard. 

It just uses basic fetching of html using the inheritance of AsyncTask<~> class. The html used in this app of the site "https://www.animecharactersdatabase.com/allchars.php?id=100053" .

I suspect the app not using the full potential of my internet connection so if anyone knows why and how to fix this please help.
